You can use site params `mainSections` and `disableDisqusTypes` to control which page types are excluded from recent posts and Disqus comments respectively.

```md
---
title: "About"
date: 2019-04-19T21:37:58+05:30
type: "page"

This is some static page where you can write about yourself.
```

## Disable Disqus

You can disable Disqus site wide if you don't set `DisqusShortname` param in config. You can also disable Disqus from contents selectively or for all contents with certain content type. Use content field `disqus` to disable Disqus from certain contents.

```md
---
title: "Content without comments"
date: 2019-04-19T21:37:58+05:30
disqus: false
---

This is a content without Disqus comments.
```

You can also disable Disqus for certain content types by using site param `disableDisqusTypes`. You can check config section above for example.
